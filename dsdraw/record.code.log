A number should have been here; I inserted `0'.

look up `weird error' in the index to The TeXbook.)

I've run across a `}' that doesn't seem to match anything.
For example, `\def\a#1{...}' and `\a}' would produce
this error. If you simply proceed now, the `\par' that
I've just inserted will cause me to report a runaway
argument that might be the root of the problem. But if
your `}' was spurious, just type `2' and it will go away.

Runaway argument?

I suspect you've forgotten a `}', causing me to apply this
control sequence to too much text. How can we recover?
My plan is to forget the whole thing and hope for the best.

! LaTeX3 Error: First argument of '\NewDocumentCommand' must be a command.

The first argument of '\NewDocumentCommand' should be the document command
that will be defined. The provided argument '\ds @record@drawfield' contains
more than one token. Perhaps a backslash is missing?

LaTeX will ignore this entire definition.

If you say, e.g., `\def\a1{...}', then you must always
put `1' after `\a', since control sequence names are
made up of letters only. The macro here has not been
followed by the required stuff, so I'm ignoring it.
