# texpackages
In this repository several packages developed by me focusing on LaTeX packages are kept.

Some packages are more "professional", aimed at general use, while others are more personal and define `.sty` files to solve specific problems I had. The latter are kept in the `jm_packages` directory.

There are completed and under development packages. Check the status of each package in its own directory, as well as installation and usage information.

Licenses are specified in individual packages. If the license is not present, assume the **LaTeX Project Public License (LPPL version 1.3c)**.
