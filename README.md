# texpackages
In this repository several packages developed by me focusing on $\LaTeX$ packages are kept.

## What do I keep here?
Some packages are more "professional", aimed at general use, while others are more personal and define `.sty` files to solve specific problems I had. The latter are kept in the directory `jm_packages`.

There are completed and under development packages. Check the status of each package in its own directory, as well as installation and usage information.

## Documentation
The directory [`docs`](./docs) contains the PDF documentation files for all packages.

## Licence
Licenses are specified in individual packages. If the license is not present, assume the **LaTeX Project Public License (LPPL version 1.3c)**.
